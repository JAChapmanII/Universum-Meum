Universum Meum is a game that allows the player to create new particles and arbitrary interactions
to build their own universe completely from scratch.

UM is currently in pre-alhpa and many things do not work. If you'd like to help us hack, drop us a
line either through github or through our emails.


Obtaining:

Github currently hosts the repo at http://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum
You can use:
	git clone git://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum.git
to clone the repository locally.


Building:

Recently the project has been ported to C++, so the build system is a little rough (though better
than before). To compile it, you will need g++, SDL headers/libs, and OpenGL headers/libs.
Once you have the build software, execute
	make
from the Universum Meum directory.

There are several targets you can use, the default being "debug"
	- full cleans everything and makes a release build and the documentatition
	- release strips debug information and optimizes fully
	- debug builds in debug information and does no optimization
	- wall builds with the -Wall parameter
	- profile builds the same as debug, but also enables profiling (gprof information)
	- documentation uses ddoc to make the documentation in docs/ (src code, not user manual)

If anybody knows how we can improve our Makefile, please let us know (we're complely wingin it now)


Running:

After the program is compiled, simply run:
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} # Note: by default the target is currently debug
from the same directory from the Universum-Meum directory.

To startup with more than the default number of particles, simply append tho number of particles
you want to see. To start up with 5 particles use:
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} 5

To make each particle start with a random velocity, add a '1' after the number of particles:
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} 5 1

To make the screen lock onto the "Sun" make the last argument be "lock":
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} 4 lock

Once the game is running it will prompt you in the console to input a width and a height for the
window. Once you do this you'll be up and running! Take a look at the Controls section for more
information.


Controls:

Particle manipulation:
	Right click in an empty place to create a new particle.
	To delete a particle, right click when the cursor is on one.

Panning/zooming:
	If "lock" is not passed as an argument, you can use the arrow keys to pan the view.
	You can use the mousewheel to zoom in and out (If you zoom in too far, the camera will stop and
													being able to view a 0x0 grid)

Adjusting framerate:
	+ on the keypad makes the framerate increase by 5 (<=1000)
	- on the keypad makes the framerate decrease by 5 (>=1)

Quiting:
	Hit the "Esc"ape key.
	If your WM has a "close" butotn, you can use that.
	kill -9 ${PROCESSID} # in bash/zsh you can use $(pgrep Universum-Meum) for ${PROCESSID}
						 # in fish you can use (pgrep Universum-Meum)
	The power button, or you can unplug the computer at either the PSU or wall if you have no UPS in
		the way.

Printing a bunch of useless information:
	Left mouse button for particles
	Middle mouse button for the screen
