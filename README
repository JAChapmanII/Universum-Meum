Universum Meum is a game that allows the player to create new particles and arbitrary interactions
to build their own universe completely from scratch.

UM is currently in pre-alhpa and many things do not work. If you'd like to help us hack, drop us a
line either through github or through our emails.

Obtaining:

Github currently hosts the repo at http://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum
You can use:
	git clone git://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum.git
to clone the repository locally.


Building:

Currently use gdc to compile Universum Meum through rebuild. Unfortunately, this part of the process
is a little bit of a mess since the gdc/tango we're using is outdated. This is because tango no
longer works with gdc. We're trying to move to a newer (ldc-based) bulid system, but for now send
Jeff an email and he'll try to help you build it. We also have an Arch Linux package with the exact
development suite we use that we can offer. Once you have the build software, execute
	make
from the Universum Meum directory


Running:

After the program is compiled, simply run:
	./bin/Universum-Meum
from the same directory from the Universum-Meum directory.

To startup with more than the default number of particles, simply append tho number of particles
you want to see. To start up with 5 particles use:
	./bin/Universum-Meum 5

To make each particle start with a random velocity, add a '1' after the number of particles:
	./bin/Universum-Meum 5 1

To make the screen lock onto the "Sun" make the last argument be "lock":
	./bin/Universum-Meum 4 lock


Controls:

Particle manipulation:
	Once the game is up, simply right click anywhere to create a new particle. Hopefully one day
	you'll be able to delete those suckers too ^^

Panning/zooming:
	If "lock" is not passed as an argument, you can use the arrow keys to pan the view.

	You can use the mousewheel to zoom in and out; however, it looks horrible when not in lock mode

Quiting:
	Hit the "Esc"ape key.
	If your WM has a "close" butotn, you can use that.
	kill -9 ${PROCESSID} # in bash/zsh you can use $(pgrep Universum-Meum) for ${PROCESSID}
						 # in fish you can use (pgrep Universum-Meum)
	The power button, or you can unplug the computer at either the PSU or wall if you have no UPS in
		the way.

Printing a bunch of useless information:
	Left mouse button
