Warning: this code is very old, and very bad. There were high aspirations for
this project of which only a little was accomplished in my time working on it.
I've just cleaned up some bitrot and converted it to use SFML2 so it compiles
again, but any continuation of this project will likely need to start as a
rewrite.


Universum Meum is a game that allows the player to create new particles and
arbitrary interactions to build their own universe completely from scratch.

UM is currently in pre-alhpa and many things do not work. If you'd like to help
us hack, drop us a line either through github or through our emails.


Obtaining:

Github currently hosts the repo at http://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum
You can use: git clone git://github.com/JAChapmanII/Universum-Meum.git to clone
the repository locally.


Building:

Recently the project has been ported to C++, so the build system is a little
rough (though better than before). To compile it, you will need g++, SFML
headers/libs, and OpenGL headers/libs.  Once you have the build software,
execute make from the Universum Meum directory.

There are several targets you can use, the default being "Universum-Meum"
	- full makes Universum-Meum and then the documentation
	- Universum-Meum makes the executable, allowing for a few modifiers
		- profile enables profiling
		- nowall disables all the extra errors and warnings
		- release optimizes instead of adding debug symbols
	- documentation uses doxygen to make the documentation in docs/
		(src code, not user manual)

If anybody knows how we can improve our Makefile, please let us know (we're
complely winging it now)


Running:

After the program is compiled, simply run
	./bin/Universum-Meum
from the same directory from the Universum-Meum directory.

To startup with more than the default number of particles, simply append tho
number of particles you want to see. To start up with 5 particles use:
	./bin/Universum-Meum 5

To make each particle start with a random velocity, add a '1' after the number
of particles
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} 5 1

To make the screen lock onto the "Sun" make the last argument be "lock":
	./bin/Universum-Meum{-target} 4 lock

Once the game is running it will prompt you in the console to input a width and
a height for the window. Once you do this you'll be up and running! Take a look
at the Controls section for more information.


Controls:

Particle manipulation:
	Left click in empty space to make a particle.
	To delete a particle, right click when the cursor is on one
		or, press d to delete the nearest one
		or, press i to delete the furthest one

Panning/zooming:
	If "lock" is not passed as an argument,
		you can use the arrow keys to pan the view.
	You can use the page{up,down} keys to zoom in and out

Adjusting framerate:
	+ on the keypad makes the framerate increase by 5 (<=1000)
	- on the keypad makes the framerate decrease by 5 (>=1)

Quiting:
	Hit the "Esc"ape key.
	If your WM has a "close" butotn, you can use that.
	kill -9 ${PROCESSID} # in bash/zsh you can use $(pgrep Universum-Meum) for ${PROCESSID}
	The power button
	Unplug the computer at either the PSU or wall if you have no UPS in the way.
